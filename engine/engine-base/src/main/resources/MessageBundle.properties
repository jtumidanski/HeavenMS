1002000_LITH_HARBOR_1=The town you are at is Lith Harbor! Alright I'll explain to you more about #bLith Harbor#k. It's the place you landed on Victoria Island by riding The Victoria. That's Lith Harbor. A lot of beginners who just got here from Maple Island start their journey here.
1002000_LITH_HARBOR_2=It's a quiet town with the wide body of water on the back of it, thanks to the fact that the harbor is located at the west end of the island. Most of the people here are, or used to be fisherman, so they may look intimidating, but if you strike up a conversation with them, they'll be friendly to you.
1002000_LITH_HARBOR_3=Around town lies a beautiful prairie. Most of the monsters there are small and gentle, perfect for beginners. If you haven't chosen your job yet, this is a good place to boost up your level.
1002000_PERION_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bPerion#k. It's a warrior-town located at the northern-most part of Victoria Island, surrounded by rocky mountains. With an unfriendly atmosphere, only the strong survives there.
1002000_PERION_2=Around the highland you'll find a really skinny tree, a wild hog running around the place, and monkeys that live all over the island. There's also a deep valley, and when you go deep into it, you'll find a humongous dragon with the power to match his size. Better go in there very carefully, or don't go at all.
1002000_PERION_3=If you want to be a #bWarrior#k then find #rDances with Balrog#k, the chief of Perion. If you're level 10 or higher, along with a good STR level, he may make you a warrior after all. If not, better keep training yourself until you reach that level.
1002000_ELLINIA_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bEllinia#k. It's a magician-town located at the far east of Victoria Island, and covered in tall, mystic trees. You'll find some fairies there, too. They don't like humans in general so it'll be best for you to be on their good side and stay quiet.
1002000_ELLINIA_2=Near the forest you'll find green slimes, walking mushrooms, monkeys and zombie monkeys all residing there. Walk deeper into the forest and you'll find witches with the flying broomstick navigating the skies. A word of warning: Unless you are really strong, I recommend you don't go near them.
1002000_ELLINIA_3=If you want to be a #bMagician#k, search for #rGrendel the Really Old#k, the head wizard of Ellinia. He may make you a wizard if you're at or above level 8 with a decent amount of INT. If that's not the case, you may have to hunt more and train yourself to get there.
1002000_HENESYS_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bHenesys#k. It's a bowman-town located at the southernmost part of the island, made on a flatland in the midst of a deep forest and prairies. The weather's just right, and everything is plentiful around that town, perfect for living. Go check it out.
1002000_HENESYS_2=Around the prairie you'll find weak monsters such as snails, mushrooms, and pigs. According to what I hear, though, in the deepest part of the Pig Park, which is connected to the town somewhere, you'll find a humongous, powerful mushroom called Mushmom every now and then.
1002000_HENESYS_3=If you want to be a #bBowman#k, you need to go see #rAthena Pierce#k at Henesys. With a level at or above 10 and a decent amount of DEX, she may make you be one after all. If not, go train yourself, make yourself stronger, then try again.
1002000_KERNING_CITY_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bKerning City#k. It's a thief-town located at the northwest part of Victoria Island, and there are buildings up there that have just this strange feeling around them. It's mostly covered in black clouds, but if you can go up to a really high place, you'll be able to see a very beautiful sunset there.
1002000_KERNING_CITY_2=From Kerning City, you can go into several dungeons. You can go to a swamp where alligators and snakes are abound, or hit the subway full of ghosts and bats. At the deepest part of the underground, you'll find Lace, who is just as big and dangerous as a dragon.
1002000_KERNING_CITY_3=If you want to be a #bThief#k, seek #rDark Lord#k, the heart of darkness of Kerning City. He may well make you a thief if you're at or above level 10 with a good amount of DEX. If not, go hunt and train yourself to reach there.
1002000_NAUTALIS_1=Here's a little information on #b#m120000000##k. It's a submarine that's currently parked in between Ellinia and Henesys in Victoria Island. That submarine serves as home to numerous pirates. You can have just as beautiful a view of the ocean there as you do here in Lith Harbor.
1002000_NAUTALIS_2=#m120000000# is parked in between Henesys and Ellinia, so if you step out just a bit, you'll be able to enjoy the view of both towns. All the pirates you'll meet in town are very gregarious and friendly as well.
1002000_NAUTALIS_3=If you are serious about becoming a #bPirate#k, then you better meet the captain of #m120000000#, #r#p1090000##k. If you are over Level 10 with 20 DEX, then she may let you become one. If you aren't up to that level, then you'll need to train harder to get there!
1002000_SLEEPYWOOD_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bSleepywood#k. It's a forest town located at the southeast side of Victoria Island. It's pretty much in between Henesys and the ant-tunnel dungeon. There's a hotel there, so you can rest up after a long day at the dungeon ... it's a quiet town in general.
1002000_SLEEPYWOOD_2=In front of the hotel there's an old buddhist monk by the name of #rChrishrama#k. Nobody knows a thing about that monk. Apparently he collects materials from the travelers and create something, but I am not too sure about the details. If you have any business going around that area, please check that out for me.
1002000_SLEEPYWOOD_3=From Sleepywood, head east and you'll find the ant tunnel connected to the deepest part of the Victoria Island. Lots of nasty, powerful monsters abound so if you walk in thinking it's a walk in the park, you'll be coming out as a corpse. You need to fully prepare yourself for a rough ride before going in.
1002000_SLEEPYWOOD_4=And this is what I hear ... apparently, at Sleepywood there's a secret entrance leading you to an unknown place. Apparently, once you move in deep, you'll find a stack of black rocks that actually move around. I want to see that for myself in the near future ...
1002002_HAVE_YOU_HEARD=Have you heard of the beach with a spectacular view of the ocean called #bFlorina Beach#k, located near Lith Harbor? I can take you there right now for either #b1500 mesos#k, or if you have a #bVIP Ticket to Florina Beach#k with you, in which case you'll be there for free.\r\n\r\n#L0##b I'll pay 1500 mesos.#l\r\n#L1# I have a VIP Ticket to Florina Beach.#l\r\n#L2# What is a VIP Ticket to Florina Beach#k?#l
1002002_UNFINISHED_BUSINESS=You must have some business to take care of here. You must be tired from all that traveling and hunting. Go take some rest, and if you feel like changing your mind, then come talk to me.
1002002_VIP_TICKET=So you have a #bVIP Ticket to Florina Beach#k? You can always head over to Florina Beach with that. Alright then, but just be aware that you may be running into some monsters there too. Okay, would you like to head over to Florina Beach right now?
1002002_HOW_TO_VIP=You must be curious about a #bVIP Ticket to Florina Beach#k. Haha, that's very understandable. A VIP Ticket to Florina Beach is an item where as long as you have in possession, you may make your way to Florina Beach for free.

1012005_TRANSFER_POINTS=In order to transfer the pet ability points, closeness and level, Pet AP Reset Scroll is required. If you take this\r\nscroll to Mar the Fairy in Ellinia, she will transfer the level and closeness of the pet to another one. I am especially giving it to you because I can feel your heart for your pet. However, I can't give this out for free. I can give you this book for 250,000 mesos. Oh, I almost forgot! Even if you have this book, it is no use if you do not have a new pet to transfer the Ability points.
1012005_CANT_GIVE_TOO_MUCH_LIFE=But Water of Life only comes out little at the very bottom of the World Tree, so I can't give him too much time in life... I know, it's very unfortunate... but even if it becomes a doll again I can always bring life back into it so be good to it while you're with it.
1012005_TRY_HARD_RAISING_IT=Talk to the pet, pay attention to it and its intimacy level will go up and eventually his overall level will go up too. As the intimacy level rises, the pet's overall level will rise soon after. As the overall level rises, one day the pet may even talk like a person a little bit, so try hard raising it. Of course it won't be easy doing so...
1012005_AFTER_SOME_TIME=After some time... that's correct, they stop moving. They just turn back to being a doll, after the effect of magic dies down and Water of Life dries out. But that doesn't mean it's stopped forever, because once you pour Water of Life over, it's going to be back alive.
1012005_DO_YOU_REALLY_WANT_TO_BUY=250,000 mesos will be deducted. Do you really want to buy?
1012005_OH_YEA_THEY_REACT=Oh yeah, they'll react when you give them special commands. You can scold them, love them... it all\r\ndepends on how you take care of them. They are afraid to leave their masters so be nice to them, show them love. They can get sad and lonely fast...
1012005_THEY_HAVE_HUNGER=It may be a live doll but they also have life so they can feel the hunger too. #bFullness#k shows the level of hunger the pet's in. 100 is the max, and the lower it gets, it means that the pet is getting hungrier. After a while, it won't even follow your command and be on the offensive, so watch out over that.
1012005_SAD_TO_SEE_THEM_STOP=Even if it someday moves again, it's sad to see them stop altogether. Please be nice to them while they are alive and moving. Feed them well, too. Isn't it nice to know that there's something alive that follows and listens to only you?
1012005_NEED_EMPTY_SLOT_AND_ENOUGH_MESOS=Please check if your inventory has empty slot or you don't have enough mesos.
1012005_NEED_PET_FOOD=Oh yes! Pets can't eat the normal human food. Instead my disciple #bDoofus#k sells #bPet Food#k at the Henesys Market so if you need food for your pet, find Henesys. It'll be a good idea to buy the food in advance and feed the pet before it gets really hungry.
1012005_FEED_ON_REGULAR_BASIS=Oh, and if you don't feed the pet for a long period of time, it goes back home by itself. You can take it out of its home and feed it but it's not really good for the pet's health, so try feeding him on a regular basis so it doesn't go down to that level, alright? I think this will do.
1012006_DO_YOU_HAVE_BUSINESS=Do you have any business with me?\r\n#L0##bPlease tell me about this place.#l\r\n#L1#I'm here through a word from Mar the Fairy...#k#l
1012006_TOO_BUSY=Hmmm ... too busy to do it right now? If you feel like doing it, though, come back and find me.
1012006_GET_THAT_LETTER=Get that letter, jump over obstacles with your pet, and take that letter to my brother Trainer Frod. Give him the letter and something good is going to happen to your pet.
1012006_WANNA_TRAIN_YOUR_PET=This is the road where you can go take a walk with your pet. You can just walk around with it, or you can train your pet to go through the obstacles here. If you aren't too close with your pet yet, that may present a problem and he will not follow your command as much... So, what do you think? Wanna train your pet?
1012006_ARE_YOU_SURE_YOUVE_MET_MAR=Hey, are you sure you've met #bMar the Fairy#k? Don't lie to me if you've never met her before because it's obvious. That wasn't even a good lie!!
1012006_OH_HERE=Ok, here's the letter. He wouldn't know I sent you if you just went there straight, so go through the obstacles with your pet, go to the very top, and then talk to Trainer Frod to give him the letter. It won't be hard if you pay attention to your pet while going through obstacles. Good luck!
1012007_BROTHERS_LETTER=Eh, that's my brother's letter! Probably scolding me for thinking I'm not working and stuff...Eh? Ahhh...you followed my brother's advice and trained your pet and got up here, huh? Nice!! Since you worked hard to get here, I'll boost your intimacy level with your pet.
1012007_BROTHER_TOLD_ME=My brother told me to take care of the pet obstacle course, but ... since I'm so far away from him, I can't help but wanting to goof around ...hehe, since I don't see him in sight, might as well just chill for a few minutes.
1012007_DID_YOU_REALLY=Hmmm ... did you really get here with your pet? These obstacles are for pets. What are you here for without it?? Get outta here!
1012007_WHAT_DO_YOU_THINK=What do you think? Don't you think you have gotten much closer with your pet? If you have time, train your pet again on this obstacle course...of course, with my brother's permission.
1012008_NEED_A_BREATHER=Hey, you look like you need a breather. You should be enjoying the life, just like I am. Well, if you have a couple of items, I can trade you for an item you can play mini games with. Now... what can I do for you?#b\r\n#L0#Create a mini game item#l\r\n#L1#Explain to me what the mini games are about#l#k
1012008_YOU_WANT_TO_MAKE=You want to make the mini game item? Mini games aren't something you can just go ahead and play right off the bat. For each mini game, you'll need a specific set of items. Which minigame it em do you want to make?#b\r\n#L4#Omok Set#l\r\n#L5#A Set of Match Cards#l#k
1012008_WANT_TO_LEARN_MORE=You want to learn more about the mini games? Awesome! Ask me anything. Which mini game do you want to know more about?#b\r\n#L2#Omok#l\r\n#L3#Match Cards#l#k
1012008_OMOK_RULES=Here are the rules for Omok, so listen carefully. Omok is a game in which you and your opponent take turns laying a piece on the table until someone finds a way to lay 5 consecutive pieces in a line, be it horizontal, diagonal, or vertical. For starters, only the ones with an #bOmok Set#k can open a game room.
1012008_MATCH_CARD_RULES=Here are the rules for Match Cards, so listen carefully. As the name suggests, Match Cards is simply finding a matching pair among the number of cards laid on the table. When all the matching pairs are found, then the person with more matching pairs will win the game. Just like Omok, you'll need #bA set of Match Cards#k to open the game room.
1012008_OMOK_NEEDS=You want to play #bOmok#k, huh? To play it, you'll need the Omok Set. Only the ones with that item can open the room for a game of Omok, and you can play this game almost anywhere except for a few places at the market place.
1012008_MATCH_CARD_NEEDS=You want #bA set of Match Cards#k? Hmm...to make A set of Match Cards, you'll need some #bMonster Cards#k. Monster Card can be obtained by taking out the monsters all around the island. Collect 15 Monster Cards and you can make a set of A set of Match Cards.
1012008_OMOK_COST=Every game of Omok will cost you #r100 mesos#k. Even if you don't have an #bOmok Set#k, you can enter the room and play. However, if you don't possess 100 mesos, then you won't be allowed to enter in the room at all. The person opening the game room also needs 100 mesos to open the room (or else there's no game). If you run out of mesos during the game, then you're automatically kicked out of the room!
1012008_MATCH_CARD_COST=Every game of Match Cards will cost you #r100 mesos#k. Even if you don't have #bA set of Match Cards#k, you can enter the room and play. However, if you don't possess 100 mesos, then you won't be allowed to enter in the room at all. The person opening the game room also needs 100 mesos to open the room (or else there's no game). If you run out of mesos during the game, then you're automatically kicked out of the room!
1012008_HOW_TO_START=Enter the room, and when you're ready to play, click on #bReady#k.\r\nOnce the visitor clicks on #bReady#k, the room owner can press #bStart#k to begin the game. If an unwanted visitor walks in, and you don't want to play with that person, the room owner has the right to kick the visitor out of the room. There will be a square box with x written on the right of that person. Click on that for a cold goodbye, okay?
1012008_OMOK_MATERIALS=#bYou want to make #t{0}##k? Hmm...get me the materials, and I can do just that. Listen carefully, the materials you need will be: #r{1} #t{2}#, {3} #t{4}#, 1 #t{5}##k. The monsters will probably drop those every once in a while...
1012008_OMOK_START=When the first fame starts, #bthe room owner goes first#k. Be warned that you'll be given a time limit, and you may lose your turn if you don't make your move on time. Normally, 3 x 3 is not allowed, but if there comes a point that it's absolutely necessary to put your piece there or face ending the game, then you can put it there. 3 x 3 is allowed as the last line of defense! Oh, and it won't count if it's #r6 or 7 straight#k. Only 5!
1012008_MATCH_CARD_START=Oh, and unlike Omok, when you create the game room for Match Cards, you'll need to set your game on the number of cards you'll use for the game. There are 3 modes available, 3x4, 4x5, and 5x6, which will require 12, 20, and 30 cards respectively. Remember that you won't be able to change it up once the room is open, so if you really wish to change it up, you may have to close the room and open another one.
1012008_REDO_OR_TIE=If you know your back is against the wall, you can request a #bRedo#k. If the opponent accepts your request, then you and your opponent's last moves will cancel out. If you ever feel the need to go to the bathroom, or take an extended break, you can request a #btie#k. The game will end in a tie if the opponent accepts the request. Tip: this may be a good way to keep your friendships in tact.
1012008_MOVE_ON_TIME=When the first game starts, #bthe room owner goes first.#k Beware that you'll be given a time limit, and you may lose your turn if you don't make your move on time. When you find a matching pair on your turn, you'll get to keep your turn, as long as you keep finding a pair of matching cards. Use your memorizing skills to make a streak.
1012008_NEXT_GAME=When the next game starts, the loser will go first. Also, no one is allowed to leave in the middle of a game. If you do, you may need to request either a #bforfeit or tie#k. (Of course, if you request a forfeit, you'll lose the game.) And if you click on 'Leave' in the middle of the game and call to leave after the game, you'll leave the room right after the game is over. This will be a much more useful way to leave.
1012008_LONGER_STREAK=If you and your opponent have the same number of matched pairs, then whoever had a longer streak of matched pairs will win. If you ever feel the need to go to the bathroom, or take an extended break, you can request a #btie#k. The game will end in a tie if the opponent accepts the request. Tip: this may be a good way to keep your friendships in tact.
1012008_WHICH_SET=The set also differs based on what kind of pieces you want to use for the game. Which set would you like to make?{0}
1012100_HALL_OF_FAME=You have walked a long way to reach the power, wisdom and courage you hold today, haven't you? What do you say about having right now #ra NPC on the Hall of Fame holding the current image of your character#k? Do you like it?
1012100_HALL_OF_FAME_FEE=You have walked a long way to reach the power, wisdom and courage you hold today, haven't you? What do you say about having right now #ra NPC on the Hall of Fame holding the current image of your character#k? Do you like it? I can do it for you, for the fee of #b{0} mesos.#k
1012100_1ST_JOB=So you decided to become a #rbowman#k? There are some standards to meet, y'know... #bYour level should be at least 10, with at least {0}#k. Let's see.
1012100_2ND_JOB_TEST=Hmmm... you have grown a lot since I last saw you. I don't see the weakling I saw before, and instead, look much more like a bowman now. Well, what do you think? Don't you want to get even more powerful than that? Pass a simple test and I'll do just that for you. Do you want to do it?
1012100_2ND_JOB_GO_SEE=Go and see the #b#p1072002##k.
1012100_2ND_JOB_BREEZE=Haha...I knew you'd breeze through that test. I'll admit, you are a great bowman. I'll make you much stronger than you're right now. before that, however... you;ll need to choose one of two paths given to you. It'll be a difficult decision for you to make, but... if there's any question to ask, please do so.
1012100_3RD_JOB=There you are. A few days ago, #b#p2020010##k of Ossyria talked to me about you. I see that you are interested in making the leap to the amazing world of the third job advancement for archers. To achieve that goal, I will have to test your strength in order to see whether you are worthy of the advancement. There is an opening in the middle of a deep forest in Victoria Island, where it'll lead you to a secret passage. Once inside, you'll face a clone of myself. Your task is to defeat her and bring #b#t4031059##k back with you.

1012100_STRONGER_NOW=You've gotten much stronger now. Plus every single one of your inventories have added slots. A whole row, to be exact. Go see for it yourself. I just gave you a little bit of #bSP#k. When you open up the #bSkill#k menu on the lower left corner of the screen, there are skills you can learn by using SP's. One warning, though: You can't raise it all together all at once. There are also skills you can acquire only after having learned a couple of skills first.
1012100_PROUD_BOWMAN=Now a reminder. Once you have chosen, you cannot change up your mind and try to pick another path. Go now, and live as a proud Bowman.
1012100_CHOOSE_OCCUPATION=Alright, when you have made your decision, click on [I'll choose my occupation] at the bottom.#b\r\n#L0#Please explain to me what being the Hunter is all about.\r\n#L1#Please explain to me what being the Crossbowman is all about.\r\n#L3#I'll choose my occupation!
1012100_TAKE_MY_LETTER=Good decision. You look strong, but I need to see if you really are strong enough to pass the test, it's not a difficult test, so you'll do just fine. Here, take my letter first... make sure you don't lose it!

1012100_NEED_TO_BE_STRONG={0} need to be strong. But remember that you can't abuse that power and use it on a weakling.

I'll be waiting for you.
1012100_CLONE=Since she is a clone of myself, you can expect a tough battle ahead. He uses a number of special attacking skills unlike any you have ever seen, and it is your task to successfully take him one on one.
